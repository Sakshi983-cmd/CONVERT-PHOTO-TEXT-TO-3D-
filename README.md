# CONVERT-PHOTO-TEXT-TO-3D-# **3D Model Generator from Photo or Text**

This project provides a simple prototype that accepts either:
- **An image** (like a chair, car, toy, etc.)
- **A short text prompt** (e.g., "A small toy car")

and generates a **basic 3D model** (.obj or .stl) that can be visualized or 3D printed.

---

## **Features**
- **Input Type**:
    - **Image Input**: A single object in `.jpg` or `.png` format.
    - **Text Prompt**: A simple description of an object like "A toy car".
  
- **Processing**:
    - For **photo input**: The object is extracted from the background using **rembg**.
    - For **text input**: (Work in progress) Converts text description into a 3D model.

- **Output**:
    - A **downloadable 3D model** in `.stl` or `.obj` format.
    - A **3D visualization** using `matplotlib`.

## **How It Works**

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - If an image is uploaded, the **rembg** library removes the background, isolating the object. This makes it easier to work on generating the 3D model.

2. **3D Model Generation**:
   - The image is converted to grayscale and resized.
   - Each pixelâ€™s intensity is used to create the height (z-axis) for the corresponding point in the 3D model.
   - The 3D mesh (vertices and faces) is generated, and the model is saved in **.stl** or **.obj** format.

3. **Visualization**:
   - The model is visualized in 3D using `matplotlib` to inspect the generated output.

4. **Download**:
   - Once the model is generated, the `.stl` file is made available for download, allowing you to 3D print or view it in a 3D viewer.

## **Steps to Run**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the repository to your local system or use it directly on **Google Colab**.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib pillow rembg numpy-stl onnxruntime
    ```

3. **Upload the Input**:
    - **For photo input**: Upload an image file (e.g., `car.jpg`).
    - **For text input**: Modify the code to integrate text-to-3D model generation (for future enhancements).

4. **Run the Code**:
    - Once the environment is set up, run the script to:
        - Preprocess the image (background removal).
        - Generate the 3D model from the processed image.
        - Visualize the 3D model.

5. **Download the Output**:
    - After generating the 3D model, download the `.stl` file for 3D printing or viewing.

## **Libraries Used**
- **numpy**: For handling numerical data and arrays.
- **matplotlib**: For 3D model visualization.
- **rembg**: For removing the background from images.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **numpy-stl**: For saving the 3D model in `.stl` format.
- **onnxruntime**: (Optional) For running any pre-trained models.

## Future Improvements
- Text-to-3D model generation*: Currently, the project focuses on image input..
- *Higher quality mesh generation*: Improve the quality of the 3D models by using better algorithms for mesh generation.
- *Interactive 3D viewer*: Implement an interactive viewer to rotate and examine the 3D models more easily.

## **Conclusion**

This prototype converts photos or text into basic 3D models using image preprocessing and 3D mesh generation techniques.
